  <h2>Pie Charts</h2>
  <div class="pie-chart-group-container">   
     <div> 
       <img src="images/1990s_Pie_Chart.png" alt="Image" style="display: inline;">
       <p>The pie chart shows 18% of high quality movies<br>
        from the 1990s are action, 10% are adventure, 30%<br> 
        are comedy, and 42% are drama.</p>
     </div>
     <div>
       <img src="images/2000s_Pie_Chart.png" alt="Image" style="display: inline;">
       <p>The distribution changes significantly from the<br> 
          90s to the 2000s. Action jumps from 18% of the<br>
          total to 29%. Comedy falls from 30% to 17%.</p>

       <p>The distribution for the 2010s is similar to the 2000s.</p>

  <h2>A Look Behind the Numbers</h2>
  <p>The 2000s have more highly rated movies than the 1990s, and the 2010s have more highly rated movies<br>
  than the 2000s. The numbers at face value suggest people have gotten better at making movies. However,<br> 
  the increase in the number of highly rated movies can be explained by other factors, like the number of<br>
  movies being made. IMDb estimates there were 15,465 movies released between 1990 and 1999 compared to 
  49,916 movies released between 2010 and 2019. The increase in the number of movies released is significantly<br>
  more than the increase in the number of highly rated movies released, which suggests that people have<br>
  gotten worse at making movies, not better. However, this is also an unfair assessment because a substantial<br>
  percentage of the movies released between 2010 and 2019 were made with limited financing. Advancements in<br> 
  technology have made it easier to produce low-budget movies, but it's unreasonable to compare these films<br>
  to big studio productions</p>
