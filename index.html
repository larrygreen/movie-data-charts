       <p>The pie chart shows 18% of highly rated movies<br>

          90s to the 2000s. Action jumps from 18% of the<br>
          total to 29%. Comedy falls from 30% to 17%.</p>

  <h2>A Look Behind the Numbers</h2>
  <p>The 2000s have more highly rated movies than the 1990s, and the 2010s have more highly rated movies<br>
  than the 2000s. The numbers at face value suggest people have gotten better at making movies. However,<br> 
  the increase in the number of highly rated movies can be explained by other factors.</p>  

  <h3>The Number of Movies Released</h3>
  <p>IMDb estimates there were 15,465 movies released between 1990 and 1999 compared to 49,916 movies<br> 
  released between 2010 and 2019. The increase in the number of movies released is significantly more<br>
  than the increase in the number of highly rated movies, which suggests that people have gotten worse<br>
  at making movies, not better. However, this is also an unfair assessment because a substantial<br>
  percentage of the movies released between 2010 and 2019 were made with limited financing. Advancements<br> 
  in technology have made it easier to produce low-budget movies, but it's unreasonable to compare these films<br>
  to big studio productions. Nevertheless, the consensus is that the number of high-budget films has increased<br> 
  each decade, but it's difficult to quantify the increase with limited access to the data.</p>

  <h3>Shifting Market Demographics and the Rise of the Superhero Movie</h3>
  <p>Our bar chart illustrates a big jump in the number of highly rated action movies released, and a notable<br>
     drop in the number of highly rated comedy movies released. Both of these occurrences can be explained<br>
     by the movie industry's shifting market demographics. The international market has grown significantly for<br>
     the major film studios, and it's more profitable to produce films that appeal to a wider audience. Hence,<br>
     the rise of the superhero movie. With exciting fight scenes, spectacular special effects, outrageous evil<br>
     villians, and larger-than-life superheroes, it's easy to see why superhero movies have universal appeal.<br>
     Superhero movies fall into the action category, and they tend to be highly rated on IMDb. On the other hand,<br>
     the comedy genre has suffered due to the growth of the international market. Everyone loves to laugh, but<br>
     there are cultural differences in humor, and it's easy for things to get lost in translation. Therefore,<br>
     less comedies are being made resulting in a decrease in the number of highly rated comedies.</p>
