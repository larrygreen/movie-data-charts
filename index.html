  <h1 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Movie Data Charts and Analysis</h1>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Project Overview</h3>
  <div class="text-container">
    <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original dataset was a .csv file and contained 9718 rows and 11 columns. I turned the .csv file into a
       Pandas DataFrame in Python, cleaned the data, and reorganized it into smaller DataFrames to analyze highly
       rated movies from the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. I only included the genres of action, adventure, comedy, and
       drama. My goal was to find the number of highly rated movies within each genre, observe the changes in these
       numbers over time, and form an understanding of what is behind these changes.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Bar Charts</h2>
  <div class="chart-group-container">   
     <div> 
       <img src="images/High_Rating_ByDecade.png" alt="Image" style="display: inline;">
       <p>• 52% increase in the number of highly rated movies from the 1990s to the 2000s<br>
          • Only a 13% increase in the number of highly rated movies from the 2000s to the<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;2010s</p>
     </div>
     <div>
       <img src="images/HighRating_DecadeGenre.png" alt="Image" style="display: inline;">
       <p>• Comedy is the only genre with a decrease in its number of highly rated movies.<br>
          • 144% increase in the number of highly rated ACTION movies from the 1990s to<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;the 2000s</p>
     </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Pie Charts</h2>
  <div class="pie-chart-group-container">   
     <div> 
       <img src="images/1990s_Pie_Chart.png" alt="Image" style="display: inline;">
       <p>The pie chart shows 18% of highly rated movies<br>
        from the 1990s are action, 10% are adventure, 30%<br> 
        are comedy, and 42% are drama.</p>
     </div>
     <div>
       <img src="images/2000s_Pie_Chart.png" alt="Image" style="display: inline;">
       <p>The distribution changes significantly from the<br> 
          90s to the 2000s. Action jumps from 18% of the<br>
          total to 29%. Comedy falls from 30% to 17%.</p>
     </div>
     <div>
       <img src="images/2010s_Pie_Chart.png" alt="Image" style="display: inline;">
       <p>The distribution for the 2010s is similar to the 2000s.</p>
     </div>  
  </div>

  <h2>A Look Behind the Numbers</h2>
  <p>The 2000s have more highly rated movies than the 1990s, and the 2010s have more highly rated movies<br>
  than the 2000s. The numbers at face value suggest people have gotten better at making movies. However,<br> 
  the increase in the number of highly rated movies can be explained by other factors.</p>  

  <h3>The Number of Movies Released</h3>
  <div class="text-container-two">
    <p>IMDb estimates there were 15,465 movies released between 1990 and 1999 compared to 49,916 movies 
    released between 2010 and 2019. The increase in the number of movies released is significantly more
    than the increase in the number of highly rated movies, which suggests that people have gotten worse
    at making movies, not better. However, this is also an unfair assessment because a substantial
    percentage of the movies released between 2010 and 2019 were made with limited financing. Advancements
    in technology have made it easier to produce low-budget movies, but it's unreasonable to compare these films
    to big studio productions. Nevertheless, the consensus is that the number of high-budget films has increased
    each decade, but it's difficult to quantify the increase with limited access to the data.</p>

  <h3>Shifting Market Demographics and the Rise of the Superhero Movie</h3>
  <p>Our bar chart illustrates a big jump in the number of highly rated action movies released, and a notable<br>
     drop in the number of highly rated comedy movies released. Both of these occurrences can be explained<br>
     by the movie industry's shifting market demographics. The international market has grown significantly for<br>
     the major film studios, and it's more profitable to produce films that appeal to a wider audience. Hence,<br>
     the rise of the superhero movie. With exciting fight scenes, spectacular special effects, outrageous evil<br>
     villians, and larger-than-life superheroes, it's easy to see why superhero movies have universal appeal.<br>
     Superhero movies fall into the action category, and they tend to be highly rated on IMDb. On the other hand,<br>
     the comedy genre has suffered due to the growth of the international market. Everyone loves to laugh, but<br>
     there are cultural differences in humor, and it's easy for things to get lost in translation. Therefore,<br>
     less comedies are being made resulting in a decrease in the number of highly rated comedies.</p>
